Payments API Integration Test Plan
	1.	Overview

Objective:
Ensure that every endpoint in the Payments API behaves as expected under valid conditions as well as when provided with invalid data, missing parameters, or faulty authentication. This plan covers testing of endpoints for users, accounts (creation and deletion), payments, and transfers.

Endpoints Covered:
• POST /users – Create a new user
• POST /accounts – Create a new account
• DELETE /accounts/{accountId} – Close an account (note: while the spec lists the parameter as a path parameter, adjust your test URL accordingly)
• POST /payments – Process a payment
• POST /transfers – Process a fund transfer

Security:
All endpoints require Bearer authentication (JWT). Tests will include scenarios with a valid token as well as missing or invalid tokens.
	2.	Pre-requisites

Test Environment:
An environment that mimics production behavior (or a dedicated test instance) with base URL and endpoint access.

Authentication Tokens:
– A valid JWT for normal testing.
– An expired or malformed token for negative authentication tests.

Data Setup:
Ability to capture and reuse dynamically generated IDs (such as userId, accountId, etc.) across multiple API calls to simulate realistic workflows.

Tools:
A REST client (for example, Postman or Insomnia) or an automated test framework (for example, pytest with requests, JUnit, etc.).
	3.	Test Cases

A. Authentication Tests

TC-AUTH-01: Valid Bearer Token
Objective: Ensure that requests succeed when a valid token is provided.
Steps:
	•	For each endpoint, include a valid JWT in the Authorization header (e.g., “Authorization: Bearer ”).
Expected Result:
	•	Requests are processed and return the expected status codes (e.g., 201 for creation, 200 for deletion).

TC-AUTH-02: Missing Bearer Token
Objective: Validate that access is denied when the token is missing.
Steps:
	•	Call any endpoint (for example, POST /users) without the Authorization header.
Expected Result:
	•	The API returns a 401 Unauthorized error (or another appropriate authentication error).

TC-AUTH-03: Invalid/Expired Bearer Token
Objective: Ensure that an invalid or expired token is not accepted.
Steps:
	•	Call an endpoint using an expired or malformed token.
Expected Result:
	•	The API returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

G. End-to-End / Integration Scenarios

TC-INTEGRATION-USER-ACCOUNT-FLOW
Scenario:
	•	Create a user via POST /users.
	•	Extract the returned userId and create one or more accounts for this user using POST /accounts.
	•	Use the created account IDs to perform a payment (POST /payments) and a funds transfer (POST /transfers).
Expected Result:
	•	All API calls succeed in sequence, and the IDs are validly linked between requests.

TC-INTEGRATION-CLOSED-ACCOUNT-OPERATION
Scenario:
	•	Create an account and then close it using DELETE /accounts/{accountId}.
	•	Attempt to initiate a payment or transfer using the closed account.
Expected Result:
	•	The subsequent payment or transfer fails (for example, returns a 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found), verifying that operations are not permitted on closed accounts.

TC-INTEGRATION-MULTIPLE-TRANSACTIONS
Scenario:
	•	Create multiple users and accounts.
	•	Simulate several payments and transfers among these accounts, including concurrent operations if supported.
Expected Result:
	•	Each transaction is processed independently and correctly, with all response schemas and statuses matching the specification.

	4.	Test Data Management

Dynamic Data:
Use responses from API calls (such as userId and accountId) to parameterize subsequent requests. This ensures realistic integration and avoids hardcoding IDs.

Validation:
For every response, verify that:
	•	The HTTP status code matches the expected value.
	•	The response JSON matches the defined schema (correct types, formats, and presence of required properties).

	5.	Reporting and Logging

Logging:
Record request payloads, headers, and responses for all test cases.

Error Reporting:
Capture any deviations from the expected responses and log error messages, HTTP status codes, and stack traces if available.

Test Summary:
Provide a final report that summarizes:
	•	Total tests executed.
	•	Tests passed/failed.
	•	Detailed failure logs for debugging.

	6.	Conclusion

This test case plan covers every endpoint in the Payments API with both positive (happy path) and negative (unhappy path) scenarios. By executing these tests, you can ensure that:
	•	The API correctly validates input data.
	•	Security (via bearer authentication) is enforced.
	•	Each endpoint behaves as expected in isolation as well as when integrated into a full user-to-transaction workflow.

Use this plan as a guide to implement your automated API integration tests, and adjust it as needed based on evolving business rules or API changes.
